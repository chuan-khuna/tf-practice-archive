Behold, the signs come from out of nowhere
Light the fire like a choir
Overlap our souls

Has no foresight
What about it?
I know, something must be done
Don’t let slip away at all
Out of control
What about it?
You know, something must be done
Don’t let slip away at all

Not that kind of empathy
Just got your telepathy
No more, such a sympathy
Though you feel antipathy
We won’t leave a legacy
Then we’ve built intimacy
No more, such a sympathy
Though you feel antipathy

Let it shine through darkness and grief
No matter how painful and brief
Insanity of a loner is bold
Who said we’d never throw in with?

If my heart ain’t dead already
Might my time hasn’t yet to come
Let me hear you shout out loud, so loud
Let me be your wedge to bind around the world
