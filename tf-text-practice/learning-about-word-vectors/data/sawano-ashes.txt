I could hear the signs calling out from the bottom of the fire
I am like a torch flickering in the wind as the saying goes

Lost all my precious
Rage ate me up
Endless forlornness has made me numb
I'd rather rise from here
Or should I hold on to my past?

They've burnt to ashes
Faded to grey
Returned to the earth
Yes it's meant to be
Uncertain flame of hope I found
Will you lead me back on the right track?
